## Colours and background in css 
In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you can use various properties to control the colors and backgrounds of elements on a web page. Here are some common CSS properties and techniques for working with colors and  
backgrounds: 

*1. Color Property:*

The color property is used to set the text color of an element. You can specify colors in various formats, such as   
->Named colors (e.g., "red," "blue")  
->Hexadecimal values (e.g., "#FF0000" for red)    
->RGB values (e.g., "rgb(255, 0, 0)" for red)   
->HSL values (e.g., "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)" for red)  
Example:  
```css
#css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

*2. Background Property:*

The background property is used to set various background properties for an element, including background color, image, and positioning.  
Example:  
```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  background-image: url('background.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
}
```

3. Background Color:  

You can set the background color of an element using the background-color property.
Example:  
```css
.container {
  background-color: #ffffff; /* White background */
}
```
